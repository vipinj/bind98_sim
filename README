This is a pure simulation to verify bind 9.8 behavior from yingdi's paper.
''Authority Server Selection of DNS Caching Resolvers''

v2: changed RTT for ns7 to 2s+120m
v3: changed RTT to inf, unresponsive ns
v4: divide the scenarios into two types, crash and recovery, where auth servers crash and recover, 
    divide each of the scenario into two, where we do a time base monitoring vs query based monitoring	
    For all the cases, we identify the value k, which is the optimal choice for figuring out stuff.
    At this instant, bind's decaying is used (0.98), which is more responsible for decreasing rtt vals.
    otherwise for this experiment, we keep the rtt's constant with {50..170}
